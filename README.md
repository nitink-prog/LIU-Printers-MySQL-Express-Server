# LIU Printers MySQL Express Server

This is a simple Express server that I use to hook up my LIU Printers Database front-end webapp to a MySQL back-end.

Admittedly, this is not an exhaustive server, but it is a mostly complete CRUD API for the MySQL database.

It would be quite easy to use this as a boilerplate for your own programs, so feel free to do so.
